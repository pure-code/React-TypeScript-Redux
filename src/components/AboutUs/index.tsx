            <Description>
                The main and permanent team consists of two developers.
                <br/><br/>
                We take projects only of our competence without the need for delegation to third-party developers. But we are not afraid of complex and interesting projects. Responsible approach to work, attentive attitude to the quality of the code, the projectâ€™s structure and the maximum usability for the user - these all  make our sites fast and efficient.
